# Content Generation: Potential Discord Guilds (Simplified with Prompt Injection)
#
# This narrative demonstrates automatic prompt assembly using template-based
# schema injection. Instead of repeating schema documentation in each act,
# the system automatically injects:
#
# 1. Schema documentation from the discord_guilds table
# 2. Platform-specific context (Discord constraints)
# 3. JSON formatting requirements
#
# Each act only contains the unique content focus - what makes this guild special.
#
# Compare this file with generate_guilds.toml to see the reduction in boilerplate!
#
# Workflow:
# 1. Run: boticelli run --narrative narratives/generate_guilds_simple.toml
# 2. Review: boticelli content list potential_guilds_simple
# 3. Rate servers: boticelli content tag potential_guilds_simple 1 --rating 5 --tags "gaming,active"
# 4. Approve favorite: boticelli content review potential_guilds_simple 1 approved
# 5. Promote to production: boticelli content promote potential_guilds_simple 1 --target discord_guilds
#
# Run with: just example-guilds-simple
